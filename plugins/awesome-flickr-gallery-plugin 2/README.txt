**Video Tutorial on How to Configure Awesome Flickr Gallery**

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGKcptkTSIs]

== Installation ==

1. Extract the contents of the zip archive to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install the plugin from your WordPress dashboard -> plugins -> add new menu
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure plugin using Awesome Flickr Gallery settings page
1. Place [AFG_gallery] in your posts and/or pages to show the default gallery or create new galleries with different settings and insert the generated code

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After upgrade to version 3.0.0, my photo descriptions appear as "array". =

Just delete the cached gallery data from "Default Settings" page of the plugin and also delete any cached pages from your caching plugins (like mentioned below).

= After upgrade, only one column appears in the gallery. =

This happens when you have a cache plugin (like WP Super Cache or W3 All Cache) installed. Old cached CSS file is loaded instead of the new one. Just delete the cached pages from your cache plugin and refresh the gallery page 2-3 times, it will appear fine.

= I have activated the plugin, but gallery doesn't load. =

Make sure your Flickr API key and Flickr User ID are correct.

= My Flickr API key and User ID are correct but the gallery doesn't load =

Make sure you add the shortcode [AFG_gallery] to your post or page where you
want to load the gallery.  This code is case-sensitive.

= When I click the photo, it doesn't open full size photo. =

Awesome Flickr Gallery uses *Colorbox* to display full size photos.  Most likey
you have another plugin enabled, which also uses the colorbox and is overriding
the Awesome Flickr Gallery settings.  It is recommended to deactivate any other
plugins that uses colorbox.

Also, some themes have built-in settings to display images using lightbox or
colorbox etc.  If your theme has such an option, turn it off.

= I have created separate galleries with different photosets as Gallery Source, but all the galleries are using Photostream as source. =

This typically happens when you are using a plugin for editing your posts/pages. Try to remove the quotes from id parameter of the shortcode and it should work fine. For example, if the shortcode for your gallery is

[AFG_gallery id='1']

, use

[AFG_gallery id=1]

instead.

Also, some themes have built-in settings to display images using lightbox or colorbox etc. If your theme has such an option, turn it off.

= I made changes to my Flickr account but they don't reflect on my website. =

Awesome Flickr Gallery uses caching to avoid expensive calls to Flickr servers.  It intelligently figures out if cache needs to be updated or not.  However, sometimes it may not work as expected.  You should go to Default Settings and delete all cached data.

= I created a gallery with source as a Group.  In this gallery, only 500 photos are appearing. =

As Flickr Groups have thousands of photos, it becomes very expensive to fetch all the photos from Flickr.  Hence, Groups galleries are limited to latest 500 photos.
