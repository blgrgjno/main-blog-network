Prevents your site visitors from ever seeing the ugly default comments error page.

== Description ==

The <a href="http://pixopoint.com/products/comment-errors/">Comment Errors Plugin</a> prevents your site visitors from ever seeing the ugly default error page in WordPress and instead redirects them back to where they were attempting to post to, and adds an appropriate error message to the comments section.

The creation of this plugin was sponsored by the <a href="http://www.dss.dep.no/">Norwegian Government Administration Services (G.A.S.)</a> and <a href="http://metronet.no/">Metronet</a>.

== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete 'comments-errors' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory OR install via the plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it. When uses would have originally seen the default WordPress error page, they will now be routed back to the post they were on and left with a convenient message telling them what went wrong / what they need to do next.

<small>Note: Your theme must make use of the comment_form() function for this to work.</small>


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It doesn't work, what's wrong? =

Your theme probably doesn't make use of the comment_form() function. You will either need to add that function to your theme, or change themes to make use of this plugin.

= Where's the settings page? =

There isn't one.

= Does it work in older versions of WordPress? =

Probably, but we only support the latest version of WordPress.
