The <a href="http://pixopoint.com/products/delete-delete-site/">Delete Delete Site Plugin</a> removes the "Delete site" link from your WordPress multisite admin panel.

The creation of this plugin was sponsored by the <a href="http://www.dss.dep.no/">Norwegian Government Administration Services (G.A.S.)</a> and <a href="http://metronet.no/">Metronet</a>.

<small>Note: This plugin is intended for WordPress multisite only and is of no use for a single site installation of WordPress.</small>

== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete 'delete-delete-site' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory OR install via the plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it, all non-"WordPress Super Admins" will no longer be able to see the "delete site" link.

<small>Note: This plugin does not remove the ability to delete the site, it just removes the link from the admin panel which <strong>should</strong> prevent users from inadvertently deleting their site. This plugin intentionally does not work if you are a "WordPress Super Administrator". This
ensures that you as the owner of the site have full control over the admin panel, yet anyone at a lower userlevel (ie:
"WordPress Administrator") will not see the link.</small>
