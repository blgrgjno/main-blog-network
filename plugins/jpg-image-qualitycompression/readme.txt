This plugin adjusts the quality of the images when they are uploaded.

== Description ==

When images are uploaded Wordpress automatically sets the image compression to 90.   This plugin lets you set the compression value; accepted values are from 1 to 100.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Go to the 'Media' page under the Settings tab and set your compression level 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I set the quality for different sizes of images? =
 
No.  This quality value is used across all images from the way that Wordpress has been developed.

= What is the default quality? =

90 is the Wordpress default, which means there is slight compression/degradation on images.  If you want the best possible images it should be set to 100.
