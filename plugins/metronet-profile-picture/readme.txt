== Description ==

Set a custom profile image for a user using the standard WordPress media upload tool.  

A template tag is supplied for outputting to a theme and the option to override a user's default avatar is also available.

This plugin is fully compatible with <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-thumbnail-editor/">Post Thumbnail Editor</a> for cropping any uploaded images.

If you like this plugin, please leave a rating/review and mark the plugin as working.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `metronet-profile-picture` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<?php mt_profile_img() ?>` in your templates (arguments and usage are below)
4. Use the "Override Avatar" function to change your default avatar.

Arguments: 

`/**
* mt_profile_img
* 
* Adds a profile image
*
@param $user_id INT - The user ID for the user to retrieve the image for
@ param $args mixed
	size - string || array (see get_the_post_thumbnail)
	attr - string || array (see get_the_post_thumbnail)
	echo - bool (true or false) - whether to echo the image or return it
*/
`

Example Usage:
`
<?php
//Assuming $post is in scope
if (function_exists ( 'mt_profile_img' ) ) {
	$author_id=$post->post_author;
	mt_profile_img( $author_id, array(
		'size' => 'thumbnail',
		'attr' => array( 'alt' => 'Alternative Text' ),
		'echo' => true )
	);
}
?>
`

The `mt_profile_img` function internally uses the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_the_post_thumbnail">get_the_post_thumbnail</a> function to retrieve the profile image.

Optionally, if you choose the "Override Avatar" function, you can use <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_avatar">get_avatar</a> to retrieve the profile image.

If you want the "Override Avatar" checkbox to be checked by default, drop this into your theme's `functions.php` file:

`add_filter( 'mpp_avatar_override', '__return_true' );`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do you set a user profile image? =

1.  Visit the profile page you would like to edit.
2.  Click "Upload or Change Profile Picture"
3.  Upload a new image and select "Set profile image", which will save the image.

To override an avatar, select the "Override Avatar?" checkbox and save the profile page.

= What role does a user have to be to set a profile image? =

Author or greater.

= How do I create specific thumbnail sizes? =

Since the plugin uses the native uploader, you'll have to make use of <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_image_size'>add_image_size</a> in your theme.  You can then call `mt_profile_img` and pass in the custom image size.

= The image is cropped wrong.  How do I fix this? = 

We highly recommend the <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-thumbnail-editor/'>Post Thumbnail Editor</a> plugin for cropping thumbnails, as you can custom-crop various image sizes without affecting other images.

= Does the plugin work with Multisite? =

Yes, but you'll have to set a new profile image per site.  This is currently a limitation of the way the plugin stores its data.  Ideas to overcome this are welcome.
