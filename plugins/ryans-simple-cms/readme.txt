The <a href="http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/products/simplecms/">Simple CMS plugin</a> converts your WordPress admin panel into a simple CMS. This is aimed at web designers who want to provide a simple adminstration panel for their clients to update basic static websites.

All extraneous admin areas which are unnecessary for a bare bones, basic CMS are removed from the administration menus.

To help with theming, we have created a theme called <a href="http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/simple-cms-theme-update/">Simple CMS theme</a> which is designed to simplify the design process for web designers by only implementing the features needed for a basic static site. The theme is not designed to look pretty, but is a practical, simple theme to build your own designs from ... <strong><a href="http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/simple-cms-theme-update/">Simple CMS Theme</a></strong>

== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete 'ryans-simplecms' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory OR install via the plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it, all non-"WordPress Administrators" will now see an admin panel which contains only the necessities for a basic CMS for a static website
4. Login as a "WordPress Editor" or lower to see the new admin panel

<small>Note: This plugin intentionally does not affect the admin panel if you are a "WordPress Administrator". This ensures that you as the owner/designer of the site have full control over the admin panel, yet anyone at a lower userlevel (ie: "WordPress Editor") will see a massively simplified panel. You can alter user levels via the "Users" option in the regular WordPress admin panel.</small>
