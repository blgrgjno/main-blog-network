Shortcodes in Sidebar Widgets plugin allows shortcodes to properly execute when they are used in sidebar text widgets.

Shortcodes in Sidebar Widgets plugin adds a light-weight filter which will allow shortcodes to properly execute when used in sidebar text widgets.  All that is needed is to download, install and activate.  I have found this plugin extremely useful for placing things like contact forms and other shortcode enabled features in sidebars

You can install Shortcodes in Sidebar Widgets directly from the WordPress admin panel. Visit the Plugins > Add New page and search for 'Shortcodes in Sidebar Widgets'. Click to automatically install.  Once installed, activate the plugin and it is functional.
