Adds the ability to use unique custom headers on individual pages, posts or categories.

== Description ==

The <a href="http://pixopoint.com/products/unique-headers/">Unique Headers Plugin</a> adds the ability to use unique custom headers on
individual pages, posts or categories. This plugin makes use of the excellent <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/taxonomy-metadata/">Taxonomy Metadata plugin</a> for handling header images for categories.

The creation of this plugin was sponsored by the <a href="http://www.dss.dep.no/">Norwegian Government Administration Services (G.A.S.)</a> and <a href="http://metronet.no/">Metronet</a>.


== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete 'unique-headers' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory OR install via the plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Install and activate the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/taxonomy-metadata/">Taxonomy Metadata plugin</a> to add support for changing images for category listings.
4. And yer done!

Now you will see sections for changing your custom headers on the posts, pages and category listings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't change the image on my categories, what's wrong? =

You need to install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/taxonomy-metadata/">Taxonomy Metadata plugin</a>. WordPress does not support
the taxonomy meta data which this plugin needs to use to store the custom header image URL. As soon as you install that plugin, the category image
functionality should beign working.


= Where's the settings page? =

There isn't one.


= Does it work in older versions of WordPress? =

Probably, but we only support the latest version of WordPress.


= I need custom functionality. Can we pay you to build it for us? =

No, I'm too busy. Having said that, if you want to pay me a small fortune then I could <a href="http://pixopoint.com/contact/">probably be persuaded</a>.
