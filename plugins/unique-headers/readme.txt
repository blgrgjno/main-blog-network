Adds the ability to use unique custom headers on individual pages, posts or categories or tags.

== Description ==

The <a href="http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/products/unique-headers/">Unique Headers Plugin</a> adds the ability to use unique custom headers on
individual pages, posts or categories. This plugin makes use of the excellent <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/taxonomy-metadata/">Taxonomy Metadata plugin</a> for handling header images for categories and tags.

The creation of this plugin was sponsored by the <a href="http://www.dss.dep.no/">Norwegian Government Administration Services (G.A.S.)</a> and <a href="http://metronet.no/">Metronet</a>. Coding assistance was provided from <a href="http://camaya.net/">Jakob Schr√∂ter</a>.


== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete 'unique-headers' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory OR install via the plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Install and activate the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/taxonomy-metadata/">Taxonomy Metadata plugin</a> to add support for changing images for category listings.
4. And yer done!

Now you will see sections for changing your custom headers on the posts, pages and category listings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't change the image on my categories/tags, what's wrong? =

You need to install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/taxonomy-metadata/">Taxonomy Metadata plugin</a>. WordPress does not support
the taxonomy meta data which this plugin needs to use to store the custom header image URL. As soon as you install that plugin, the category/tag image
functionality should begin working.


= Where's the settings page? =

There isn't one.


= Does it work in older versions of WordPress? =

Probably, but we only support the latest version of WordPress.


= I need custom functionality. Can we pay you to build it for us? =

No, I'm too busy. Having said that, if you are willing to pay me a small fortune then I could <a href="http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/contact/">probably be persuaded</a>.
